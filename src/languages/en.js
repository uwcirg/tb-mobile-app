    Questions and answers about tuberculosis
    `,

    intro_1: `
    This is a list of frequently asked questions about tuberculosis (TB),
    medications and other issues related to TB and the answers.
    `,

    intro_2: `
    What it is, how it is transmitted, and how is TB treated.
    `,

    q1: {
      question: `
      What is TB?
      `,

      answer: {
        1: `
        Tuberculosis or TB is a disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
        The main infection of the disease occurs in the lungs,
        although it can attack other parts of the body.
        Pulmonary TB is the only type with the capacity to infect other people
        who are in regular and close contact for several hours in the
        day. TB is spread through the air when a person
        coughs / sneezes / talks / sings releasing small
        droplets that contain live bacilli.
        `,

        2: `
        Not all people in contact with a sick person releasing the bacteria with cough get sick. Most often the person who becomes sick
        has lowered immune defenses, due to the presence of
        other diseases such as diabetes, other infections such as the
        AIDS, or tumors, transplants, or poor nutrition.
        `,

        3: `
        With good defenses an individual can can become infected with the bacteria,
        but not necessarily get sick, but become infected,
        without developing the disease. In this case it is known as a latent TB infection.
        These people do not feel bad, they do not present symptoms nor can they
        transmit TB to other people. However, some
        people with the infection get sick later on.
        `,

        4: `
        The good news is that people with the TB can receive treatment and be cured.
        `,
      },
    },

    q2: {
      question: `
      How is it transmitted?
      `,

      answer: {
        1: `
        TB is transmitted from one person to another through the air.
        The bacteria are released into the air
        when a person with TB disease in the lungs coughs, sneezes, speaks or sings.
        People who are close by can breathe in these bacteria and become infected.
        `,

        2: `
        When a person breathes the TB bacteria,
        the bacteria can enter into the lungs and begin to multiply.
        From there they can move
        by blood to other parts of the body,
        such as the kidneys, the spine and the brain.
        `,

        3: `
        TB disease in the lungs or throat may be
        contagious. This means that the bacteria can be transmitted to
        others. Tuberculosis that affects other parts of the body,
        like the kidneys or the spine, is usually not
        contagious
        `,

        4: `
        People with TB disease have more
        probability of transmitting it to the people with whom they live
        every day, such as family, friends and co-workers and class.
        `,

        5: `
        It is important to:
        `,

        "6-bullets": {
          1: `
          Screen ALL the contacts that live with the person who has TB.
          `,

          2: `
          Vaccinate the newborn with the BCG vaccine to prevent
          serious forms TB
          `,

          3: `
          Cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze.
          `,

          4: `
          Teach in schools, in the neighborhood and in the community
          that we ALL must participate in the fight against tuberculosis.
          `,
        },
      },
    },

    q3: {
      question: `
      What are the tests to detect the infection?
      `,

      answer: `
      To know if a person was in contact with the bacteria or not
      a skin test, the Mantoux reaction or tuberculin test is done.
      `,
    },

    q4: {
      question: `
      How is it treated?
      `,

      answer: {
        1: `
        The treatment is highly effective and can cure.
        For the treatment to be effective,
        it requires taking the medication daily.
        The treatment is a combination of several medications
        to eliminate most of the bacteria in in the first 2 months.
        The treatment must be continued with a second phase of 4 months,
        to kill the rest of the bacteria that remain in the body.
        `,

        2: `
        If you have TB disease in the lungs or throat,
        the disease is likely to be contagious.
        You must stay at home and not go to work or school,
        to prevent transmiting TB to others.
        After taking the medication for a few weeks you will feel better
        and it is possible that the disease is no longer contagious.
        Your doctor or nurse will inform you
        when you can return to work, school or see your friends.
        `,

        3: `
        Having TB disease should not stop you
        from having a normal life.
        When the disease is no longer contagious and you do not feel bad,
        you can do the same things that you did before the illness.
        `,

        4: `
        It is important to have a sputum test in the first 2 months,
        before moving on to the second phase of treatment,
        along with the routine assessments.
        `,

        5: `
        Directly observed treatment (DOT) should be used, which is when a
        Health staff supervises you taking the medication. In general, the
        supervised treatment is performed in a health center near your
        home. In the first 2 months the supervision in the taking of the
        medication is daily, while in the following 4 months it can be
        2 to 3 doses per week.
        `,

        6: `
        There are many reasons why people have problems
        taking their medication. In most cases, there is something that
        can be done.
        `,

        7: `
        Both the diagnosis and the treatment of TB are free
        in health centers and public hospitals throughout the country.
        `,
      },
    },

    q5: {
      question: `
      What are the undesirable effects of tuberculosis drugs?
      `,

      answer: {
        1: `
        The medications used can cause some undesirable effects that must be taken into account to consult with the health team. Effects can cause and in some cases should consult.

      question: `
      Why do I have to take tuberculosis medicine on a regular basis?
      `,

      answer: {
        1: `
        The TB bacteria die very slowly. The
        medications take at least 6 months to destroy all
        TB bacteria. You will probably start to feel
        better after only a few weeks of treatment. But remember there are still TB bacteria in the body.
        You must continue taking your medications until all
        the TB bacteria are dead, even if you
        feel better and have no more symptoms of TB disease.
        `,

        2: `
        It can be very dangerous if you do not keep taking your medications or if you do not
        Take them regularly. The TB bacteria will multiply again and you could remain sick for a longer time.
        In addition, bacteria can become resistant to the medications if not taken correctly. You may need different medications
        to kill the TB bacteria. These new medications must be taken for much longer
        and, generally, have more serious side effects.
        `,

        3: `If your disease becomes contagious again,
        you could transmit TB bacteria to your family,
        your friends or anyone who spends time with you.
        It is very important that you take your medications
        as instructed by your doctor or nurse.

      How can I remember to take my medications?

        1: `
        The only way to be cured is by taking your medications exactly
        as directed by your doctor or nurse.
        It may not be easy!
        You must take your medications
        for a long time (6 months),
        It is good that you establish a routine.
        Here are some ways to remember to take your medications:

        2: {
          1: `
          Take your medicines every day at the same time, for example,
          before breakfast, or during a regular rutine time
          such as a coffee break or after brushing your teeth.
          `,

          2: `
          Ask a family member or friend to remind you to take your pills.

          3: `
          Mark on a calendar every day that you take your medications.
          `,

          4: `
          Put your medications in a weekly pillbox.
          Place it next to your bed or your wallet or purse.

        3: `
        If you miss a day of taking your medications,
        skip that dose and wait to take the next dose.
        Tell your doctor or nurse if you missed taking a dose.
        You can also call them to ask what you should do.

    q8: {
      question: `
      How can I prevent spreading it to others?
      `,

      answer: {
        1: `
        The main way to avoid spreading TB is to take all your medicines
        and follow the exact instructions of your doctor or nurse.
        You also need to go to all your medical appointments!
        Your doctor or nurse should see how your condition is progressing.
        You may need another chest x-ray or a sputum test.
        These tests will show if the medicaments are working.
        The test will also indicate if you can still spread TB to other people.
        Be sure to tell your doctor if you think something is wrong.

        2: `
        If your infection is contagious and you are staying at home,
        there are steps that you can take to protect the people around you:

        3: {
          1: `
          Take the medication as directed.
          This is very important!
          `,

          2: `
          Always cover your mouth with a tissue
          whenever you cough, sneeze, or laugh.
          Put the used tissue in a bag, close it and throw it away.
          `,

          3: `
          You can prevent spreading the infection by using a face mask
          until your sputum test comes back is negative.
          `,

          4: `
          It is important tos screen all contacts,
          especially those younger than 15
          and even more important those under the age of 5.
          This age group is a priority
          to evaluate and provide preventative treatment
          (also called prophylaxis)
          when the active disease was ruled out.
          `,

          5: `
          Air out your room often to the outside of the building
          (if it is not too cold outside).
          TB spreads in small closed spaces where air doesn’t move.
          Put a fan in your window
          to blow out (exhaust)
          air that may be filled with TB bacteria.
          If you open other windows in the room,
          the fan also will pull in fresh air.
          This will reduce the chances
          that TB bacteria will stay in the room
          and infect someone who breathes the air.
          `,
        },

        4: `
        Remember, TB is spread through the air.
        People cannot get infected with TB bacteria through handshakes,
        sitting on toilet seats,
        or sharing dishes and utensils with someone who has TB.
        `,

        5: `
        After you take the medicines for about 2 or 3 weeks,
        you may no longer be able to spread TB bacteria to others.
        If your doctor or nurse agrees,
        you will be able to go back to your daily routine,
        including returning to work or school.
        Remember, you will get well
        only if you take your medicines
        exactly as directed by your doctor or nurse.

        6: `
        Think about people who may have spent time with you,
        such as family members, close friends, and coworkers.
        It is very important that all contacts are evaluated and assessed
        for sign and symptoms suspicious of TB.
        In symptomatic respiratory contacts a sputum test should be conducted.
        TB is especially dangerous in children and people with HIV.
        If they are infected with the TB bacteria,
        they should take medication immediately to avoid TB disease.
